## Deployment
It is currently being developed and the live progress can be seen here: https://jaynepal.pythonanywhere.com/

## Self-hosting
The code isn't currently complete, but is being actively developed. The legacy algorithm script is in the main.py file, but it is being refactored to work in the front-end slowly and incorporated into app.py

To run the program in a local environment, please create a .env file in the same directory as the app.py file with your Spotify dev credentials for a project
